# Number Guessing Game 🎲

A beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and user interaction.

---

## 📝 Project Description

The **Number Guessing Game** is an interactive program where the computer randomly selects a number within a given range (1 to 100). The player tries to guess the number, and the program provides feedback after each attempt. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number and also tracks the number of attempts made.

## 🎯 Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Uses Python's `random` module to generate a target number.
- **Player Interaction**: Accepts player input and validates it.
- **Feedback System**: Provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempt Counter**: Tracks and displays the number of attempts.
- **Replay Option**: Allows the player to restart the game or exit.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) for running the script.

### Running the Game
1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing.py


📋 How to Play
The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.
You are prompted to guess the number.
If your guess is:
Too high: The program will display "Too high, try again!"
Too low: The program will display "Too low, try again!"
Correct: The program will display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts you made.
After guessing correctly, you can choose to play again or exit.

🌟 Key Learning Outcomes
- **Random Number Generation: Learn to use Python's random module.
- ** Conditional Statements: Compare user input with the target number.
-  ** Loops: Implement a while loop for repeated attempts.
-   ** User Interaction: Take and process player input with error handling.
-   **  Code Modularity: Structure the program using functions.
